 Designed by Cosimo Lorenzo Pancini with the help of Francesco Canovaro, Unigeo is an eulogy to the design style of vintage computing, with its obsession for geometric modularity, ultra-tight tracking and striped rainbow overload. It aims at giving a new perspective to the ever-useful geometric sans genre, by adding a vintage flair to selected letters while keeping optical adjustments to the minimum, to prioritize the modular, constructed look aspect of the typeface.  
   
 Furthermore, like every vintage gaming system, Unigeo has been developed with different "memory versions":32, 64 and 128. The main family, Unigeo 64, is display and logo-design oriented, featuring tight tracking and iconic signature letterforms, and referencing vintage design and typefaces from the photo-lettering era. These letterforms are substituted in the Unigeo 32 variant with more contemporary shapes, resulting in a workhorse geometric sans, highly optimized for text use but still suited for logo design and display use thanks to its wide weight range. Last but not least, the Unigeo 128 subfamily gives the same skeleton a striped treatment reminescent of optical art and modernist computer logos.   
   
 All Unigeo families are developed in eight weights, ranging from Thin to Extrabold, for a total of 40 styles, each provided with an extended character set covering languages using latin, cyrillic and greek glyphs. Full Open Type Features are provided, including positional numbers, legatures and alternate glyphs, as well as a variable font version for each subfamily.
